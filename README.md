The sumo robot project aims to create an autonomous robot capable of competing in sumo wrestling matches and line tracking. The primary purpose of the project is to design and program a robot that can effectively detect and respond to its environment, including identifying the edge of the ring to avoid falling out and locating an opponent to push them out of the ring.
